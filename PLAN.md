# PLAN.md — RustOS Build Plan

This plan turns the requirements in `AGENTS.md` into ordered, assignable
work. Each **Stage** is delivered by a separate task (and likely a separate
agent). A stage is complete only when:

- All listed deliverables exist.
- All listed tests pass under `cargo xtask test`.
- All listed documentation is written and links cleanly.
- `AGENTS.md` rules have been observed (no hacks, no duplication, no
  weakened tests, no missing docs).

Do **not** begin a stage before all its listed dependencies are complete.

---

## Stage 0 — Repository Foundation

**Dependencies:** none.

**Deliverables**
- Workspace `Cargo.toml` listing every planned crate (empty crates allowed
  as placeholders, but each must compile).
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning a specific nightly with the required components
  (`rust-src`, `llvm-tools-preview`, `clippy`, `rustfmt`).
- `.cargo/config.toml` declaring per-target build flags and linker scripts.
- `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `deny.toml` (license + advisory rules).
- `tools/xtask/` with subcommands: `build`, `test`, `clippy`, `fmt`,
  `docs-check`, `abi-check`, `coverage`, `ci`, `image`.
- `docs/` mdBook scaffold.
- CI definition (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` or equivalent) running
  `cargo xtask ci` on every push.
- `LICENSE`, `README.md` (short), `AGENTS.md` (exists), `PLAN.md` (this file).

**Tests**
- `cargo xtask ci` passes on a clean clone.
- Workspace builds for every Tier-1 target with empty crates.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/architecture/overview.md` — one-page system map.
- `docs/src/contributing.md` — points to `AGENTS.md`.

**Status: complete.**
- Workspace `Cargo.toml` lists every planned crate; the empty placeholders
  all build under `cargo build --workspace --all-targets --locked`.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pins `nightly-2026-05-27` (rustc 1.98.0-nightly)
  with `rust-src`, `llvm-tools-preview`, `clippy`, `rustfmt` and all four
  Tier-1 cross targets. The original `nightly-2024-09-01` pin (rustc 1.82)
  was bumped here so that `cargo-deny ≥ 0.19` — which is required to parse
  RUSTSEC entries using CVSS 4.0 — can be installed and run; the older pin
  blocked the full `cargo deny check`.
- `.cargo/config.toml` declares the `xtask` alias plus per-target rustflags
  for `x86_64-unknown-none`, `aarch64-unknown-none`,
  `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`, and `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `deny.toml` are in place and enforced via
  `cargo xtask ci`; the deny policy passes `advisories + bans + licenses +
  sources` on the bumped toolchain.
- `tools/xtask` exposes the closed set of subcommands required by
  `AGENTS.md` §7 / §14: `build`, `test`, `clippy`, `fmt`, `docs-check`,
  `abi-check`, `coverage`, `ci`, `image`. `abi-check` deliberately fails
  loudly if only one half of the `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs` ↔
  `kernel/syscall/src/table.rs` pair appears.
- `docs/` ships a mdBook scaffold (`book.toml`, `src/SUMMARY.md`,
  `introduction.md`, `contributing.md`, `architecture/overview.md`) and the
  Stage 1 per-crate `lib/*` pages.
- CI definition `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `cargo xtask ci` on every
  push and pull request, with cargo + xtask-helper-tool caches.
- `LICENSE-APACHE`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md` are
  all present at the repository root.

---

## Stage 1 — Shared Libraries (`lib/`)

**Dependencies:** Stage 0.

**Deliverables**
- `lib/abi`: stable `#[repr(C)]` types for syscalls, IPC messages, manifests,
  errors, capability IDs. Versioned (`abi-v1`).
- `lib/caps`: `Capability`, `CapabilitySet`, delegation/revocation primitives,
  serializable token format (signed by the local authority key).
- `lib/collections`: only collections actually required by stages 2–6.
- `lib/crypto`: thin, audited wrappers around vetted upstream crates
  (e.g. `ring`, `rustcrypto`). No hand-rolled primitives.
- `lib/log`: structured, level-filtered, no-alloc-on-hot-path logging with
  stable event IDs.
- `lib/util`: only items used by ≥ 2 crates.

**Tests**
- Unit tests in each crate, mirror layout (§7).
- Property tests for `lib/caps` delegation rules (a delegated set is always
  a subset of the parent).
- Fuzz target for `lib/abi` decoding.

**Docs**
- One page per crate under `docs/src/`.
- Rustdoc on every public item.

**Status: complete.**
- All six `lib/*` crates implemented (`abi`, `caps`, `collections`, `crypto`,
  `log`, `util`), `no_std`, with rustdoc on every public item and unit tests
  alongside the code per §7.
- `lib/abi` ships frozen `abi-v1` types (`Errno`, `CapabilityId`,
  `SyscallNumber`, `IpcMessageHeader`, `ManifestHeader`) plus a deterministic
  100 000-input fuzz harness in `lib/abi/tests/fuzz_decode.rs`.
- `lib/caps` enforces the subset-only delegation invariant; an exhaustive
  property test exercises every 2⁸ subset of the well-known capabilities.
- `lib/crypto` exposes audited SHA-256 and Ed25519 verification only;
  upstream crates are pinned exactly (`sha2 = =0.10.9`,
  `ed25519-dalek = =2.1.1`, with the `zeroize` feature enabled so the
  dalek crate's own internal key material is wiped on drop; `lib/crypto`
  does not take `zeroize` as a direct dependency because it exposes
  verification only).
- `lib/util` is intentionally empty per `AGENTS.md` §2.3; no item yet
  satisfies the ≥ 2-use rule.
- The syscall ABI lives in `lib/abi/src/syscall.rs` (singular); the
  cross-checked `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs` and `kernel/syscall/src/table.rs`
  pair is reserved for Stage 2 so `cargo xtask abi-check` always sees both
  halves.
- `cargo xtask ci` is fully green: fmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), tests,
  rustdoc (`-D warnings`), mdbook, in-tree link check, and the full
  `cargo deny check` (advisories + bans + licenses + sources) all pass on
  the bumped toolchain (`nightly-2026-05-27`, rustc 1.98.0-nightly).
- Coverage measured with `cargo llvm-cov` clears `AGENTS.md` §7 thresholds:
  `lib/caps` 98.19 % lines, `lib/crypto` 96.84 % lines (≥ 95 % floor);
  `lib/abi`, `lib/collections`, `lib/log` all ≥ 95 % (≥ 85 % floor);
  workspace total 98.29 %.

---

## Stage 2 — Kernel Core (architecture-neutral)

**Dependencies:** Stage 1.

**Deliverables**
- `kernel/core`: kernel entry, panic handler (logs and halts; never silently
  resets), boot-time invariants, global init order.
- `kernel/mem`:
  - Physical frame allocator (buddy + bitmap).
  - Virtual memory manager (per-process page tables).
  - Kernel slab allocator with guard pages.
  - Zero-on-free policy for sensitive regions.
  - `Result`-returning allocation API (no panic on OOM).
- `kernel/sched`: SMP-aware scheduler (per-CPU run queues, work stealing,
  priority + fairness, IPI-based preemption).
- `kernel/sync`: spinlocks, RW locks, MCS locks, RCU-equivalent, all
  documented with their use cases.
- `kernel/ipc`: capability-checked message ports, shared memory objects,
  asynchronous notifications.
- `kernel/sec`: user/group/capability tables, manifest verification,
  audit log writer.
- `kernel/syscall`: dispatch table generated from `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs`.

**Tests**
- Host-side unit tests for every algorithm that does not need hardware.
- QEMU-based integration tests for memory isolation: a test process
  attempting to read another's memory must fault.
- Stress test for the scheduler under load on ≥ 4 emulated cores.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/architecture/kernel.md`, `…/memory.md`, `…/scheduler.md`,
  `…/ipc.md`, `…/security.md`, `…/syscalls.md`.

**Sub-stages**
- [x] 2.1 — `kernel/sync`: spinlocks, IRQ-safe spinlock, writer-preference
      RwLock, MCS queue lock, SeqLock, epoch-based reclamation, `Once`/
      `OnceCell`. Loom-gated concurrency tests in `kernel/sync/tests/loom.rs`,
      proptest fairness test in `kernel/sync/tests/rwlock_fairness.rs`,
      decision tree in `docs/src/architecture/sync.md`.
- [x] 2.2 — `kernel/mem`: buddy/bitmap `FrameAllocator` honouring a typed
      `BootMemoryMap`, per-process `AddressSpace<P: PageTableOps>` with a
      `HostPageTable` test double behind `#[cfg(test)]`, kernel `Slab`
      with guard pages on both sides, `alloc_sensitive` / `free_sensitive`
      zero-on-free backed by `zeroize`, and `Result<_, AllocError>` on every
      allocation path (no panic on OOM). Property tests in
      `kernel/mem/tests/proptest_frame.rs`, loom-gated concurrency tests in
      `kernel/mem/tests/loom.rs`, architecture documentation in
      `docs/src/architecture/memory.md`.
- [x] 2.3 — `kernel/sched`: SMP-from-day-one scheduler. Per-CPU bounded
      Chase–Lev style work-stealing queues (`kernel/sched/src/runqueue.rs`),
      MLFQ priority + fairness with periodic boost
      (`kernel/sched/src/scheduler.rs`, citing Arpaci-Dusseau OSTEP ch. 8),
      IPI-based preemption hook behind the `SchedulerArch` trait, and
      cancellation-safe `spawn`/`park`/`unpark`/`exit` lifecycle. Host-only
      `TestArch` is gated behind the `test-arch` Cargo feature and never
      links into production builds. Tests: deterministic integration tests
      on ≥ 4 simulated cores (`kernel/sched/tests/scheduler.rs`),
      10 000-task stress test asserting no deadlock and bounded latency
      (`kernel/sched/tests/stress.rs`), loom-gated concurrency test for
      the run-queue's lock-free fast path (`kernel/sched/tests/loom.rs`).
      Architecture documentation in `docs/src/architecture/scheduler.md`.
- [x] 2.4 — `kernel/sec`: in-memory `IdentityTable` builder/verifier
      (`kernel/sec/src/identity.rs`) covering users, groups, and
      supplementary-group sets with bounded sizes; per-task
      `TaskCapabilities` (`kernel/sec/src/captable.rs`) whose effective
      set is the intersection of the user grant and the manifest
      request, with delegation/revocation routed through `lib/caps`
      and signed `CapabilityToken` application; Ed25519 manifest
      verification (`kernel/sec/src/manifest.rs`) refusing on bad
      signature, ABI mismatch, or unknown capability; audit log writer
      with stable event IDs `1_000..2_000` (`kernel/sec/src/audit.rs`)
      emitting exactly one record per security decision per
      `AGENTS.md` §5.4.4; "no ambient authority" locked in by unit
      tests against `uid == 0`. Property tests for the task-level
      subset invariant live in
      `kernel/sec/tests/proptest_invariants.rs`. Documentation in
      `docs/src/architecture/security.md`. Stage 2.4 was renumbered
      from the original PLAN's 2.5 to match the Stage 2.4 task brief.
- [x] 2.5 — `kernel/ipc`: capability-checked typed message ports
      with a lock-free closed-state fast path
      (`kernel/ipc/src/port.rs`), explicit capability-gated
      shared-memory objects backed by `kernel/mem`'s zero-on-free
      `SensitiveBuffer` whose revocation atomically invalidates every
      live mapping (`kernel/ipc/src/shmem.rs`), and lossless
      OR-accumulating asynchronous notifications gated by the same
      bind-/send-time capability split as ports
      (`kernel/ipc/src/notify.rs`). Per-endpoint required-capability
      declarations are enforced at port creation **and** on every
      send; receivers do not re-check (`AGENTS.md` §5.2 final bullet).
      Every rejection path emits one structured audit record via
      `kernel/ipc/src/audit.rs` against the reserved
      `3_000..4_000` event-id range. Tests: inline unit tests in each
      module, integration tests in `kernel/ipc/tests/integration.rs`
      for the destruction-during-in-flight-send and
      shared-memory-revocation-racing-mapper scenarios, plus a
      loom-gated harness for the send fast path in
      `kernel/ipc/tests/loom.rs`. `Errno::MessageTooLarge`
      (semantically `EMSGSIZE`) was appended to `lib/abi`. The
      no-allocation audit-field formatters previously living in
      `kernel/sec` were promoted to `lib/util::fmt` once
      `kernel/ipc` became a second consumer (`AGENTS.md` §2.2 / §6).
      Architecture documentation in `docs/src/architecture/ipc.md`.
- [ ] 2.6 — `kernel/syscall` (dispatch table generated from
      `lib/abi/src/syscalls.rs`).
- [ ] 2.7 — `kernel/core` (kernel entry, panic handler, boot invariants,
      global init order).

---

## Stage 3 — Architecture Ports

**Dependencies:** Stage 2 (interface-level; implementations land in parallel
sub-stages).

Each sub-stage delivers one architecture. They share the same checklist:

- Boot stub (minimal assembly, justified per `AGENTS.md` §1).
- Early console (serial/UART/framebuffer/WASM console).
- MMU / page-table primitives wired into `kernel/mem`.
- Context switch + interrupt entry/exit.
- Timer + IPI plumbing for `kernel/sched`.
- Per-arch syscall entry.
- QEMU run script in `tools/qemu/<arch>.rs`.

**Sub-stages**
- 3a — `kernel/arch/x86_64` (BIOS + UEFI boot, APIC, ACPI minimal).
- 3b — `kernel/arch/aarch64` (Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 + QEMU virt; GIC).
- 3c — `kernel/arch/riscv64` (QEMU virt; PLIC, CLINT).
- 3d — `kernel/arch/wasm32` (browser sandbox; cooperative scheduling backed
  by `requestAnimationFrame` / `MessageChannel`; "MMU" enforced by WASM
  memory isolation between worker contexts).

**Tests (per sub-stage)**
- Boots to `init` placeholder in QEMU / browser headless harness.
- Memory-isolation test passes.
- Timer interrupt drives scheduler.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/platform/<arch>.md` with build, run, and debug instructions.

---

## Stage 4 — Driver Framework and First Drivers

**Dependencies:** Stage 2 + at least one Stage 3 sub-stage.

**Deliverables**
- `lib/abi/src/driver/` driver traits per class
  (`Display`, `Filesystem`, `Block`, `Net`, `Input`, `Bus`).
- Driver host in `userland/` that loads/unloads `.rxe` driver modules,
  enforcing capabilities at load time.
- Initial drivers:
  - `drivers/display/vesa` (x86_64 BIOS).
  - `drivers/display/framebuffer` (aarch64 Pi, riscv64 virt, wasm32 canvas).
  - `drivers/bus/pci` (x86_64), `drivers/bus/mmio` (aarch64/riscv64),
    `drivers/bus/virtio` (cross-arch).
  - `drivers/storage/virtio_blk`.
  - `drivers/input/ps2` (x86_64), `drivers/input/usb_hid` (cross-arch later).
  - `drivers/network/virtio_net`.

**Tests**
- Mock-host unit tests for each driver.
- QEMU integration: load driver → use device → unload driver → reload.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/drivers/overview.md` and one page per driver class.
- Each driver crate ships a `README.md` (supported HW, caps, limits).

---

## Stage 5 — Filesystem

**Dependencies:** Stage 4 (`Filesystem` trait + a block driver).

**Deliverables**
- `drivers/filesystem/rustfs`: native FS, copy-on-write, ACL + capability
  gates per inode, journaled, POSIX-compliant (latest standard targeted).
- `drivers/filesystem/ext4`: read/write driver (uses upstream-audited parser
  where possible; otherwise implemented in-tree with tests).
- `drivers/filesystem/fat32`: read/write (for EFI system partition and SD
  cards).
- VFS layer in `kernel/core` (path resolution, mount table, permission
  enforcement via `kernel/sec`).

**Tests**
- POSIX FS test suite (`pjdfstest`-equivalent) run under QEMU.
- ACL + capability gate tests: a user without `CAP_AUDIT_READ` cannot read
  a file marked as such, even with mode 0644.
- Crash-consistency tests for `rustfs` journal.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/filesystem/{overview,rustfs,ext4,fat32,permissions}.md`.

---

## Stage 6 — Userland Foundations

**Dependencies:** Stages 2–5 sufficient for at least one platform.

**Deliverables**
- `userland/init` (PID 1): service manager, dependency-ordered start,
  reaper, capability granting from manifests.
- `userland/shell`: POSIX-ish shell with job control and a small builtin set.
- `userland/login`: text login that authenticates against `kernel/sec` and
  spawns a shell or a graphical session. Always starts in text mode; offers
  graphical mode only when a display driver and `userland/wm` are available.
- Core CLI utilities (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `ps`, `mount`,
  `chmod`, `chown`, `useradd`, `groupadd`, `setcap`, `getcap`).
  Each utility is its own small crate under `userland/apps/`.

**Tests**
- Integration tests: boot to login, log in, run each utility, exercise
  permission denials.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/userland/{init,login,shell,utilities}.md`.

---

## Stage 7 — Graphics, Window Manager, Iconbar

**Dependencies:** Stage 6 + a display driver from Stage 4.

**Deliverables**
- `userland/wm`: compositing window manager. Per-window surfaces, damage
  tracking, GPU acceleration where a driver exposes it, software fallback
  otherwise.
- `userland/iconbar`: RISC OS-style iconbar with pinned app slots, mounted
  filesystem icons, and a status area.
- Default theme + cursor set.
- A handful of default apps under `userland/apps/`: filer, text editor,
  terminal emulator, settings panel (users, groups, permissions, caps).

**Tests**
- Headless compositor tests using a virtual framebuffer.
- Input routing tests (focus, drag-and-drop save model).

**Docs**
- `docs/src/desktop/{wm,iconbar,apps,theming}.md`.

---

## Stage 8 — Installer and Image Builders

**Dependencies:** Stages 5, 6 (and 7 for the graphical installer path).

**Deliverables**
- `userland/installer` with text and graphical front-ends sharing one core
  library. Functions per `AGENTS.md` §11.
- `tools/mkimage` producing:
  - `images/rustos-x86_64.iso` (hybrid BIOS/UEFI).
  - `images/rustos-aarch64-rpi.img`.
  - `images/rustos-riscv64.img`.
  - `images/rustos-web/` static tree.

**Tests**
- End-to-end QEMU install: build image → boot → run installer → reboot →
  log in as the created user → verify permissions and partition layout.
- Browser headless test for the `wasm32` image.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/install/{x86_64,raspberry_pi,riscv64,web}.md`.

---

## Stage 9 — Security Hardening and Audit

**Dependencies:** all earlier stages feature-complete.

**Deliverables**
- Threat model document (`docs/src/security/threat_model.md`).
- Fuzz harnesses for every parser (filesystem, ABI, manifest, IPC).
- Sandboxing review of every driver currently running in-kernel; move to
  user space if at all possible.
- `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` clean across the workspace.
- Reproducible builds (`tools/xtask repro`).

**Tests**
- Fuzz campaigns run in CI for a bounded time on every PR.
- Penetration test scripts under `tests/security/`.

**Docs**
- `docs/src/security/{threat_model,hardening,audit_log,reporting}.md`.

---

## Stage 10 — Release Engineering

**Dependencies:** Stage 9.

**Deliverables**
- Versioning policy (semver applied to ABI, distinct from product version).
- Release checklist in `docs/src/release.md`.
- Signed releases of all four images.
- Upgrade path documentation (`abi-vN` → `abi-vN+1`).

---

## Cross-cutting Tasks (run continuously alongside the stages)

These never "finish"; they are part of every PR.

- **Tests:** new code ships with tests; failing tests block merge.
- **Docs:** every change updates rustdoc and the relevant `docs/src/` page.
- **Lints:** `clippy -D warnings`, `fmt --check`, `cargo deny` always pass.
- **Coverage:** thresholds from `AGENTS.md` §7 are enforced.
- **ABI checks:** `cargo xtask abi-check` runs on every PR; ABI changes
  require a version bump and a migration note in `docs/src/abi/`.
- **No duplication:** code reviewers reject duplication; refactor into
  `lib/` instead.

---

## Assignment Notes for Task Dispatchers

When handing a stage to an implementing agent, the task brief **must**:

1. Reference this `PLAN.md` and the `AGENTS.md` charter explicitly.
2. List the stage's deliverables, tests, and docs verbatim.
3. State the dependencies that are already satisfied.
4. Forbid stubs, `todo!()`, ignored tests, and `#[allow(...)]` without
   justification.
5. Require the agent to quote actual `cargo xtask test` output on completion.

A stage delivered without the above is to be returned for rework, regardless
of how much code was produced.
