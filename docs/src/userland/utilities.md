# Core CLI utilities (`userland/apps` and `userland/shell`)

Stage 6 ships a set of small command-line utilities, each its own crate.
The first to land is `sysinfo`; this page documents it and is extended
as the others (`ls`, `cp`, `ps`, `mount`, …) arrive.

## `sysinfo` — the System Information CLI (`userland/shell/sysinfo`)

`rustos-sysinfo` is the single command-line tool that exposes the System
Information API to the terminal (`AGENTS.md` §16.6). RustOS has no
`/proc` and no `/sys`; every piece of live system information is served
by `/System/Services/sysinfod` over the typed, versioned, capability-
checked `sysinfo-v1` wire surface defined in `rustos_abi::sysinfo` (see
[System Information API (`sysinfo-v1`)](../abi/sysinfo.md) and the
[System Information service](./sysinfod.md)). `sysinfo` is a *client* of
that API: it does **not** read a virtual filesystem, and there is no
privileged path that bypasses the capability check.

The crate is `no_std` (with `alloc`), has no `unsafe`, and no
`unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths (`AGENTS.md` §2.9). Its
only dependency is the audited `rustos-abi` crate, so it never links a
kernel or driver crate (`AGENTS.md` §17.4).

### Commands

| Command              | Query                 | Capability           |
|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| `processes`          | `SELF_PROCESS_LIST`   | none                 |
| `processes --all`    | `GLOBAL_PROCESS_LIST` | `CAP_SYSINFO_GLOBAL` |
| `memory`             | `KERNEL_MEMORY_STATS` | `CAP_SYSINFO_KERNEL` |
| `hardware`           | `HARDWARE_TREE`       | `CAP_SYSINFO_HW`     |
| `identity`           | `SYSTEM_IDENTITY`     | none                 |
| `uptime`             | `UPTIME`              | none                 |
| `help` (the default) | —                     | none                 |

`processes` accepts the `-a`/`--all` flag; the other subcommands take no
arguments and `ps`/`mem`/`hw`/`id` are accepted as short aliases. The
capability gate lives in `sysinfod`, not in this tool — `sysinfo` only
ever issues the queries the frozen registry defines, never a free-form
"raw query id".

### A request/render machine, not a data source

`run` turns one parsed `Command` into a typed request and renders the
typed reply, through three steps:

1. Build the `SysinfoRequestHeader` (and, for `processes`, a
   `ProcessListRequest` payload) from the `sysinfo-v1` ABI.
2. Hand the encoded request to the injected `Transport`, which carries
   it to `sysinfod` and returns the reply bytes. The transport owns the
   reply allocation, so the client never guesses a buffer size.
3. Decode the reply with the ABI's fail-closed `from_bytes` decoders and
   write one rendered line per row to the injected `Output`.

`Transport` and `Output` are the only two operations that reach the
outside world. On a running system they are IPC- and console-backed; in
tests they are in-memory fixtures, so every rendering and paging
decision is testable without a kernel — the same seam discipline as
`init` (`Spawner`/`Reaper`) and `login` (`Prompt`).

### Paging

A process list can be longer than a single reply, so `sysinfo` pages it:
it issues `ProcessListRequest`s with an increasing `offset` and a fixed
`limit`, rendering each page, until a page comes back shorter than the
limit. The paging loop lives in the client; the ABI carries only the
`offset`/`limit` fields.

### Fail closed

- A capability denial returns from `sysinfod` as
  `Errno::PermissionDenied`, which the CLI renders as a precise "this
  query requires a capability you do not hold" diagnostic
  (`SysinfoError::PermissionDenied`) without inventing a parallel policy
  (`AGENTS.md` §2.2, §16.6).
- An unknown subcommand, an unknown flag, or a stray trailing argument
  is a `SysinfoError::Usage` that issues no query and prints the usage
  banner.
- A reply that does not decode against `sysinfo-v1` — a truncated
  scalar, or a process page whose length is not a whole number of
  records — is a hard `SysinfoError::Service` error, never a
  partially-rendered guess.

The hardware-tree wire format is owned by `lib/abi` (`AGENTS.md` §18.1)
and is not built yet, so `sysinfo hardware` honestly reports the byte
length the service returned rather than pretending to decode it
(`AGENTS.md` §2.1).

### Tests

`cargo test -p rustos-sysinfo` drives the parser and the request/render
engine against an in-memory `sysinfod` stand-in and a recording output:
the command grammar (every subcommand, alias, and the usage-error
paths), every query's rendering, process-list paging across a page
boundary, self-vs-global query routing, and the denied, malformed,
truncated, and dead-console fail-closed paths.
