//! `plans/SOUND.md` SND4 QEMU integration test: boot the production
//! x86_64 `tairix-kernel` pipeline against the shared whole-disk audio-root
//! image — whose read-only `/System` volume carries the kernel-signed virtio
//! sound driver bundle and the test-only `audiotone` fixture — with a virtio
//! sound device attached behind QEMU's `wav` audio backend, and prove the
//! whole audio path end to end with an exact numeric assertion.
//!
//! ## What this vertical asserts
//!
//! The production boot path discovers the sound device, `devmgr` autoloads
//! the signed driver into its **own user process** (it claims a reserved
//! `audiochan-v1` endpoint and publishes its channel node), `devmgr` hands
//! that endpoint to **`audiod`**, and the scripted root shell runs
//! `audiotone`, which opens an `audio-v1` stream, queues a deterministic
//! signal, starts the device and drains. Three processes and two shared PCM
//! rings are between the program and the hardware, so a frame provably
//! crosses two real process boundaries here.
//!
//! The guest's own `AUDIO PASS` witness says the stack reported success with
//! no lost frames. The **host-side** assertion says more: QEMU's `wav`
//! backend wrote what the emulated card actually received, and the harness
//! checks it holds exactly the samples the guest played. A mixer that
//! silently substituted, resampled or dropped frames would still print the
//! witness, so the run needs both.
//!
//! The run is deterministic rather than a race: the ring is sized to hold the
//! whole signal, so every frame is queued before the device is clocked and
//! the device cannot run dry however slowly the emulated machine runs.
//!
//! ## How it differs from a production kernel
//!
//! It reuses the entire production x86_64 boot pipeline unchanged. The only
//! difference is that it is a dedicated test bin the harness drives; there is
//! no in-kernel QEMU-exit shortcut to leak into a production build.
